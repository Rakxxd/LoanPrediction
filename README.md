# LoanPrediction
Classification with Hyperparameter Tuning and Stacking

## This notebook contains information about how we can handle imbalanced dataset, also contains hyperparameter tuning for 2 of the most famous kaggle winnng algorithms XGBoost and LightGBM. 
## This notebook also covers how stacking can be used with these 2 models. This can be a good learning curve for anyone who wants to get high accuracy on datasets.
## The data used for this notebook is Loan Prediciton dataset picked from Analytics Vidhya Hackathon.
